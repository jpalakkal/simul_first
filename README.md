### Summary
simul is a social media consolidation app. It will start as a web app with expansion into mobile apps later.

### Detailed App Overview
This targets all social media users and simplifies the use of social media sites by allowing users to check all their social media feeds in one place.

The app is customizable by each user by allowing them to add only the social media feeds they use on a regular basis. Feeds can be added, ordered, and removed by the user to their personal preference.

### Minimum Functionality
We are hoping to have the app working and showing feeds from at least 2 social media sites.
